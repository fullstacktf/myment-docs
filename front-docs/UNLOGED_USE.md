# What would the unloged user do
### (from the landing to dowload)

**FIRST OF ALL:**
- this would be the demo use
- the objective of the document is to correlate fronted and backend work
- all the use is atached to changes (in order to adjust the work on both sides)

## LANDING PAGE USE STEPS:
1. the unloged (and also the loged user) user should see a big button which change the view to the itinerary generator.
2. if the button is clicked the user is redirected to the itinerary generator page view.

## ITINERARY GENERATOR PAGE STEPS:

1. the unlogged user will see only avalaible the short itinerary generator option under a location input.
2. down the header bar, the main content on a first instance is a "start" button, which displays a tag selector form, __only if the        location was written__. Under the other case, a *warning* displays claiming for a valid location input.
3. before the current tags were added (in the 3 categories), a "generate" button will be activated.
4. when the "generate" button is clicked the backend provides the necesary info to generate a content to the view in order to display      the current itinerary which can be downlowable in PDF format through a button.
