# Components Summary

## Description

A summary of all the components we must code and its status.  I suggest to add the current status of each component. And no, It will not replace the git's issues, but it will complement it.

Status legend:
- P (pending task). the component dev has been not started.
- VD (Visual Done): the basic aspect (undeed animation can wait) of the component has been coded, but the logic of it its not finished.
- WL (Working in Visual): someone is working in the html+css
- LD (Logic Done): all the methods has been established
- LW (Working in Logic): someone is working the logic of the component
- TD (Totally done): the component is operating
