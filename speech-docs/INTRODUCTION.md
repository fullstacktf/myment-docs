# Speech Project

Our speech will be show to product owners and businessman. For start we provide the next structure:

## 1. History telling

Alice is a travel girl. All month she fly to other countries for work and never has time to prepare the plans for travel.
 > \- What are you doing Alice?? 

 > \- I don't know... 

 > \- Wait! I have the solution

 > \- Look **myment**!!

 Then Alice go to **myment** !!! 
 ##### And go fast !!
 You don't need to fill absurds forms with your data, or data for other bussines, you only go to *myment.me* and activate the **GPS**. Myment only ask you three tags for filter your preference and **WALA**! You can take the itinerarie for explore, enjoy and life new real experiences share by native people on your live cities, towns and hotels.

 But Is this viable ? 

## 2. Stats show

We go to different API's of open data on different countries like San Francisco, London and New York and studies this cases. When the people travel for work is too normal, the 80% of the people sleep on the airport on scales and lost a lot of time and not consuming on the local market and not promoting the local bussines.

This app can be a social and sharing without direct benefits, but in the indirect relations we can provide connections and relations with bussiness.
