# API SERVICES
The databases CRUD operation are designed by services. For that purposes we need to know that each service has some capabilities designed by concept and can be modified by needs on the future. 

We have four services:

1. [User](./USER_API.md)
2. [Location](./LOCATION_API.md)
3. [Tags](./TAGS_API.md)
4. [Activities](./ACTIVITIES_API.md)
5. [Moments](./MOMENTS.md)

The services can be deployed in three forms, monolithic, microservices or functional, depends on demand.
